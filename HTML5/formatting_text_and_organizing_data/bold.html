    <p>As Albert Einstein once said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge
             is limited. Imagination encircles the world. The true sign of
             intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This quote speaks to the idea that creativity and 
        original thinking are more important than simply 
        accumulating knowledge. It suggests that being able
         to see beyond what is already known and to imagine 
         new possibilities 
        is a key characteristic of intelligence.</p>

        <p>I recently read <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>

    <p>As Steve Jobs once said, 
        <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/steve_jobs_416096">
            Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
